            We are a nonprofit public benefit organization dedicated to helping
            and training people who are pursuing a career as a software
            engineer.
          </h5>

          <h6>What does that mean?</h6>
          <p class="font-weight-light">
            We help low income earners who are struggling financially and
            looking for a job. We teach them how to code and work with local
            government agencies to help them financially so they can focus on
            learning. Learning how to code will be their full time job!
          </p>
          <p class="font-weight-light">
            Local community members are welcome to participate, everyone is
            welcome.
          </p>

          <h6>Where to find us?</h6>
          <p class="font-weight-light">
            Due to the current COVID-19 situation, all our meetings have moved
            online. Find out more from our
            <a href="https://www.meetup.com/San-Jose-C0D3/">
              San Jose Coding Meetup Page </a
            >.
          </p>
          <p class="font-weight-light">
            All of our educational material is 100% free and our volunteers are
            working round the clock to answer questions and help you along.
          </p>

          <h6>What is the curriculum like?</h6>
          <p class="font-weight-light">
            First, students learn the foundation track. This covers JavaScript
            functions, arrays, objects, and classes.
          </p>
          <p class="font-weight-light">
            Next, they learn nodejs by building projects starting with server
            specific tasks such as processing and manipulating files and images
            all the way to server-client interfaces like express, apis, etc.
          </p>
          <p class="font-weight-light">
            Once a strong foundation is built, our students would get work
            experience by contributing to our core codebase. We are building
            several internal products that students use on a daily basis (think
            gmail, dropbox, firebase, slack etc). Project teams function like
            any high-quality engineering team with weekly sprints and extensive
            code reviews.
          </p>

          <h6>How long does it take?</h6>
          <p class="font-weight-light">
            To create a non-competitive learning environment and prevent
            students from comparing themselves with each other, we encourage
            students learn at their own pace. Each lesson in our curriculum
            comes with dozens of practice problems and students progress to the
            next lesson after completing all the challenges and having each
            challenge code reviewed and approved. Students move at their
            learning pace and ‘graduate’ when they have contributed 5
            comprehensive features to our codebase.
          </p>

          <h6>How do you ensure quality and scale?</h6>
          <p class="font-weight-light">
            When a student completes a lesson, they are required to teach that
            lesson to incoming students. To create a positive and personalized
            learning environment, each teacher will teach at most 2 students at
            a time to encourage in-depth discussions for each lesson.
          </p>

          <h6>How is your curriculum different?</h6>
          <p class="font-weight-light">
            We believe in training students with the intention of hiring back
            every single one of them if we can. This means that we follow every
            industry best-practices. For example, students are code reviewed
            from the first line of code they write by a more experienced student
            to promote a healthy mindset where students feel comfortable getting
            critiqued and giving constructive feedback. We value communication
            and teamwork over individual accomplishments so students grow their
            skills by contributing to team projects after completing the basic
            lessons.
          </p>

          <h6>What do you do with donation money?</h6>
          <p class="font-weight-light">
            The more money with raise, the more people we can support! Our
            mission is to help people struggling financially by not only
            teaching them how to code, but also help them financially as they
            learn.
          </p>
